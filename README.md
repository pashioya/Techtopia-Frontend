## Techtopia Theme Park - Frontend Project

Welcome to the frontend project for Techtopia Theme Park! This repository focuses on the user interface and user experience components of our theme park management system. Techtopia is the ultimate destination for tech enthusiasts and adventure seekers, offering a unique blend of real-world attractions, augmented reality adventures, and IoT-enabled elements.

## Introduction

At Techtopia, we've seamlessly integrated cutting-edge technology to provide visitors and park management with an unforgettable experience. From heart-pounding roller coasters to mind-bending virtual reality quests, our park takes guests on a journey like no other. This frontend project is dedicated to the points of interest application, which will be used by both visitors and park management.

## Getting Started

To successfully complete this project, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Get Familiar with React

Before diving into the points of interest application, it's essential to get familiar with React. You can use a separate exercise (Soundboard) to build your React skills.

### Step 2: Transform UI-Related User Stories into Wireframes

Once you're comfortable with React, transform the UI-related user stories into wireframes. These wireframes will serve as visual blueprints for the application's user interface.

### Step 3: Kick-off Implementation

Kick off the implementation phase. If necessary, mock (parts of) the backend to proceed with the frontend development.

### Step 4: Iterate on Implementation

Iterate on the implementation using the concepts and knowledge you've gained. Continuously improve the user interface and user experience.

## Project Management

In this repository, we use GitLab as a single source of truth. Please ensure the following:

- Maintain a clean commit history for each repository.
- Clearly document user stories and track progress.
- Create a project dashboard with the following columns: Open, Ready, Doing, Closed.
    - Open: user stories that are identified but not entirely clear to you.
    - Ready: user stories that are clear and ready for development.
    - Doing: user stories you are currently implementing.
    - Closed: user stories that are completed.

## Wireframes and Documentation

For effective project management, consider the following aspects:

- Create wireframes for each screen or screen state. Paper sketches are allowed (take pictures in that case), but a digital tool is advised.
- Provide lightweight documentation, including domain models, activity diagrams, command and event catalogs, and a UX test report.

For specific evaluation details, please refer to the Programming 6 - Introduction slides.

Let's work together to create an outstanding theme park experience for our visitors and efficient park management for Techtopia!
